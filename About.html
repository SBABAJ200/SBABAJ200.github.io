        <h2>Datasets Used</h2>
        <p>This application uses datasets related to both diabetes and heart disease. The diabetes dataset was obtained from the Iraqi society which specializes in Endocrinology and Diabetes. The Stroke prediction dataset was obtained from Kaggle. These datasets include various medical indicators and risk factors such as age, smoking, cholesterol levels, BMI, and others that help predict the likelihood of these conditions. It is a combination of these key attributes that help generate a prediction. Our disease prediction application leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide users with relatively accurate risk assessments.</p>
        
        <h2>Diabetes Dataset</h2>
        <p>The diabetes dataset includes indicators like glucose levels, BMI, age, and other factors known to be associated with the onset of diabetes. Using machine learning, the model analyzes these features to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic.</p>

        <h2>Cardiovascular Disease Dataset</h2>
        <p>The Stroke dataset used in our disease prediction application is derived from the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data" available on Kaggle. This dataset comprises 5,110 patient records, each with 12 key attributes related to health status and lifestyle factors. These attributes include both categorical and quantitative variables such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose levels, and more. By analyzing these factors, our application can assess the likelihood of an individual suffering from a stroke.</p>
